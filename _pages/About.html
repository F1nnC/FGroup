        <h2 class="text-primary"><strong>Finn: DevOps</strong></h1>
        <p class="text-secondary">I'm Finn and I like skating. I love computer science and school. I want to get into a good college when I grow up. As the DevOps I have contributed quite a bit to my team. I have the most experience with computer science so I was able to teach my group members how to code correctly. I created the repository and do all of the commits. I also finished the Top ten page with an API, helped with all the tabs, and answered many of my team members questions.</p>

        <h1 class="text-primary"><strong>Why we liked this idea</strong></h1>
        <p class="text-secondary">We chose to make this website because we all enjoy music. Even though we choose to listen to different genres, we all use spotify. It is the main thing we all have in common. It also seems like a very helpful website for others. </p>
